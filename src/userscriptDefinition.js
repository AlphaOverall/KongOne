<b>What's new in this update?</b><br>
Some of us worked on a major refactor behind the scenes that theoretically didn't affect the script functionalities much.<br>
It added a way to toggle scripts on and off (Settings Cog -> KongOne), and added a few items.<br>
However, it was never released or fully completed.<br>
<br>
Since a recent Kongregate update apparently broke the original Kongregate One scripts, I (AlphaOverall) did some updates on the refactor to fix the major scripts, did a little cleanup, and released this new version.
I would rather have done more testing, but since the script was broken anyway I thought this was a good time to push out the changes and then you all can tell me if something is broken! :D<br>
<br>
Anyways, if you find issues, please log them on <a href='https://github.com/AlphaOverall/KongOne/issues'>GitHub</a> and I will try to fix them. I think I'm all alone now :(<br><br>
Yours truly, --AlphaOverall
